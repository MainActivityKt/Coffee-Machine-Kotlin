# Coffee Machine

This project simulates a coffee machine.

The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups;
if it runs out of something, it shows a notification.

One can get three types of coffee:
espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothingâ€™s for free, it also collects the money.

## Stage 1/6: Making coffee
In this stage, a number of texts is printed out to the console.
